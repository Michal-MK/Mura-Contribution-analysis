# CSV like format
# <weight>, <match_distance>, <pattern>
# One statement per line, pattern can therefore only match one line, new lines in the pattern are not allowed
# <match_distance> is the number of string modifications while the string is still considered a match
# i.e. 0 means exact match, 2 means two modifications are allowed, comparison is done on stripped lines! no whitespace!
